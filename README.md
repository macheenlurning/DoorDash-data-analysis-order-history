# Machine Learning and DoorDash - What Should We Eat Today?

### Below you will find a basic description of the project and the process we take to cross the finish line. As a new Data Analytics student, this project will be another step toward achieving my personal goal of becoming a Value-Driven Data Scientist.

### Project Description

Initial Goal - To see if we can create a program that will accurately predict what I would like to order from DoorDash on a given day.

Current Limitations:
- Personal Knowledge of Machine Learning program design: as a new student, given my own limited knowledge on machine learning and the capabilities of one man to build such a program, I'm not entirely sure this is even possible. This limitation should dissipate as we progress through the project.
- Is the goal Prediction? or Persuasion? I will have to further determine whether or not our program should accurately "predict" what I am already planning on ordering, or if it will simply give me suggestions of what to order. In the first scenario, I may have to backtest this by ordering DoorDash for a few weeks and then use the model to see if my recent Order History matches the machine's predictions. In the second scenario, will these machine learning suggestions end up being sub-conscious persuasions? Or an accurate model for predicting what my stomach is thinking? Maybe both?
- DoorDash does not provide your order history in a downloadable format....trust me I tried for three days begging customer service. This means we will have to scrape the website for the data, which may not even be possible. Or I will have to do what our forefathers did: roll up those sleeves and get it done.
- Mentally I'm planning for about 3 weeks worth of work on this project, but out of sheer noobieness I simply have no way to gauge how long said program will take to build. I'm prepared to do whatever it takes to complete the project, even if I end up hitting the self-destruct button to save humanity from a potentially weaponized DoorDash AI.


### Business Goals

The goal of this project is to discover an already prepared data source, and see if we can implement a machine learning model and predictive analytics to gather valuable insight.


### Data Sourcing

We will first source for our project data through various websites to find a compelling data set. If there is a lack of interest in our findings, then we will look to scrape the web.


### Understanding the Data

This section includes:
* Describing the data
* Exploring the data
* Data cleaning


### Preparing the Data

This section may include:
* Importing 
* New Variable Assignments
* Splitting Data for Testing / Holdout


### Modeling 

This section will include the predictive modeling we used to achieve the desired business goals.


### Evaluation and Analysis

This section will include the final analysis of our outcome.
